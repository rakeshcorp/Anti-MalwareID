Anti-MalwareID<br>
---------------<br>
This program will detect unknown malware sample with heuristics based on API imports<br>
acting as a virtual sandbox and defining the probable behaviour of a malware exe<br>
There are limitations as this will work only on unpacked and normal malware files as<br>
API imports will be not be retrieved statically from import table for executables which are<br>
packed, unless they are unpacked.<br><br>

The heuristics are:<br>
1. Import APIs for prevalent malware<br>
2. Import APIs for Anti-Sandbox/Anti-VM tricks<br>
3. Import APIs for Anti-Debugging tricks<br><br>

Signatures:<br>
Sample signature file is included, this will provide json based db where youcan define signatures with<br> 
attributes like syscall number, behaviour description, threat type and a probable score.<br><br>

Score: Score is weight attached to a particular API, and there will be max, min and avg score calculated for all API matches.<br><br>

Limitation:<br>
The APIs included in signatures will form the deciding factor as some APIs might exist in whitelisted files too and not based<br>
solely on API, but on the combination or order of APIs which are generally involed in malware will help in efficient detection.<br><br>

Setup:<br>
Dependencies:<br>
Python module: pefile<br>
Python module: hashlib<br><br>

Usage: python malwareid.py <pe_file><br><br>
